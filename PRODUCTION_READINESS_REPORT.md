# Production Readiness Report - VendorSoluce

**Date:** 2026-02-20  
**Scope:** `packages/app` (React/Vite SPA) + `packages/website` (static marketing site)

---

## Executive Summary

The VendorSoluce monorepo was audited for production readiness across security, performance, reliability, and deployment configuration. Several critical and moderate issues were identified and fixed. The application now builds successfully with improved security posture and optimized bundle splitting.

**Overall Verdict: CONDITIONALLY READY** - All critical blocking issues have been resolved. Remaining items are recommendations for ongoing improvement.

## Issues Found & Fixed

### CRITICAL (Fixed)

| # | Issue | Fix Applied |
|---|-------|------------|
| 1 | **Build failure** - Missing `react-is` dependency caused `vite build` to fail with unresolved import from `recharts` | Added `react-is` to `package.json` dependencies |
| 2 | **Hardcoded credentials in source code** - Supabase URL and anon key were hardcoded as dev fallbacks in `src/utils/config.ts` | Removed hardcoded values; credentials must now come from `.env.local` or deployment platform |
| 3 | **XSS vulnerability** - `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in `TemplatePreviewPage.tsx` used unsanitized regex-generated HTML | Added DOMPurify sanitization with restricted allowlist (`<span>` + `class` only) |
| 4 | **Missing security headers** - No HSTS or CSP headers configured for production deployment | Added `Strict-Transport-Security` and `Content-Security-Policy` to both `vercel.json` and `netlify.toml` |

### MODERATE (Fixed)

| # | Issue | Fix Applied |
|---|-------|------------|
| 5 | **Oversized JS bundle** - `react-vendor` chunk was 557KB (all React + recharts + Sentry combined) | Split into `react-core` (162KB), `charts` (380KB), and `react-plugins` (10KB) |
| 6 | **Sentry misconfiguration** - `tracePropagationTargets` only included `localhost` | Added `vendorsoluce.com` and `vendortal.com` production domains |
| 7 | **No HTML cache busting** - `index.html` had no `Cache-Control` header, could serve stale SPA shell | Added `Cache-Control: public, max-age=0, must-revalidate` for `/index.html` |
| 8 | **Website missing security headers** - `netlify.toml` lacked HSTS, Permissions-Policy, CSP, and asset caching | Added comprehensive security headers and static asset caching |

## Remaining Recommendations (Not Blocking)

### Resolved in Follow-Up

The following items from the original audit have been resolved:

- ~~Upgrade `jspdf`~~ -- Upgraded to 4.2.0, resolving all 7 high-severity CVEs
- ~~Replace Tailwind CDN~~ -- `vendor-threat-radar.html` now uses compiled CSS
- ~~Add `social-preview.png`~~ -- Created `social-preview.svg` and updated meta tags
- ~~Complete TODO items~~ -- Implemented PDF report generation and email service integration
- ~~Add integration tests~~ -- 35 new tests for ProtectedRoute, ErrorBoundary, Checkout, Security
- ~~Remove `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs`~~ -- Removed unused Next.js-specific packages
- ~~Clean up workspace root~~ -- Organized scripts, SQL, docs into `scripts/`, `archive/`
- ~~Add `dns-prefetch`~~ -- Added hints for Stripe, Vercel Analytics, and font CDNs

### Still Open

1. **Implement CSP nonces** - Current CSP uses `'unsafe-inline'` for scripts/styles (needed for React). For stronger security, implement nonce-based CSP with server-side nonce injection.

2. **Monitor bundle sizes** - The `charts` chunk (380KB) and `main` chunk (419KB) are borderline. Consider further splitting if they grow.

3. **Remaining npm audit vulnerabilities** - 16 vulnerabilities remain, all in ESLint and its transitive dev dependencies (`minimatch`, `ajv`). These do not ship to production. Upgrading to ESLint 9+ would resolve them.

4. **Fix pre-existing test failures** - 18 existing test files have failures unrelated to this audit. These should be triaged and fixed.

5. **Convert `social-preview.svg` to PNG** - Some social platforms (notably LinkedIn) require PNG/JPG for OG images. Convert the SVG to a 1200x630 PNG for maximum compatibility.

6. **Deploy Supabase Edge Function for email** - The `send-email` Edge Function is now invoked by `assessmentService.ts` but must be deployed on Supabase with the email provider (SendGrid, AWS SES, etc.).
