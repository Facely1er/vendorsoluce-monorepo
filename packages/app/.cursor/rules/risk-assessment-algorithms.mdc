## Core Risk Scoring Components

### Vendor Risk Calculator
- Multi-dimensional risk scoring incorporating:
  - Data sensitivity level (weight: 4)
  - Access control rating (weight: 3) 
  - Security controls score (weight: 3)
  - Compliance status (weight: 2)
  - System exposure (weight: 3)
- Normalized to 0-100 scale with thresholds:
  - Critical: ≥80
  - High: 60-79
  - Medium: 40-59 
  - Low: <40

### SBOM Analysis Scoring
- Component risk calculation based on:
  - CVE severity weights
  - Component criticality
  - NTIA compliance score
- License compliance scoring
- Vulnerability density metrics
- Overall SBOM health score (0-100)

### NIST SP 800-161 Compliance Scoring
- Category-based scoring across:
  - Governance (25%)
  - Supplier Management (25%)
  - Product Security (20%)
  - Incident Response (15%)
  - Information Sharing (15%)
- Section completion thresholds:
  - Full compliance: ≥85%
  - Partial compliance: 60-84%
  - Non-compliant: <60%

### Risk Propagation Engine
- Weighted risk propagation through vendor relationships
- Impact calculation based on:
  - Direct vendor criticality
  - Dependency depth
  - Risk inheritance rules
- Cumulative risk aggregation
