Core Assessment Pipeline Components:

1. Vendor Assessment Orchestrator
Location: src/services/assessment/orchestrator.ts
Importance Score: 95/100

Workflow Stages:
- Initial vendor onboarding assessment
- SBOM document collection and validation
- Framework-specific questionnaire delivery
- Evidence collection and validation
- Risk score calculation
- Compliance status determination
- Recommendation generation

2. SBOM Analysis Pipeline
Location: src/services/sbom/analyzer.ts
Importance Score: 90/100

Processing Steps:
- Format detection (CycloneDX/SPDX)
- Component inventory generation
- License compliance validation
- Vulnerability correlation
- Risk scoring based on:
  - Component criticality 
  - Vulnerability severity
  - Usage context
  - Update availability

3. Compliance Validation Engine
Location: src/services/compliance/validator.ts 
Importance Score: 85/100

Framework Processing:
- NIST SP 800-161 control mapping
- Section-based scoring (0-100)
- Evidence requirement tracking
- Gap analysis generation
- Automated remediation planning

4. Recommendation Pipeline
Location: src/services/assessment/recommendations.ts
Importance Score: 80/100

Generation Logic:
- Risk-based prioritization
- Framework-specific guidance
- Implementation difficulty scoring
- Cost-benefit analysis
- Timeline recommendations
- Dependency consideration

Integration Points:
- Assessment results feed vendor management
- SBOM analysis triggers risk updates
- Compliance status affects vendor rating
- Recommendations drive remediation planning
