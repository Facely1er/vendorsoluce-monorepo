        <h2>4. RISK ASSESSMENT</h2>
        
        <h3>4.1 Risk Assessment Methodology</h3>
        <div class="fill-in">
            <p>The organization employs a risk-based methodology aligned with NIST SP 800-161 and ISO 31000 risk management principles. The assessment process includes:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Risk Identification:</strong> Systematic identification of supply chain risks through supplier assessments, threat intelligence, and vulnerability analysis</li>
                <li><strong>Risk Analysis:</strong> Evaluation of identified risks considering likelihood of occurrence and potential impact on organizational objectives</li>
                <li><strong>Risk Evaluation:</strong> Comparison of risk levels against organizational risk tolerance and prioritization for treatment</li>
                <li><strong>Risk Treatment:</strong> Selection and implementation of appropriate risk mitigation strategies</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Risk levels are determined using a combination of qualitative and quantitative factors, including supplier security posture, component vulnerability status, business criticality, and threat intelligence. Risk acceptance decisions require approval from the CISO or designated risk authority based on documented risk tolerance criteria.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>4.2 Risk Categories</h3>
        <div class="fill-in">

                <li><strong>Intellectual Property:</strong> Risks to intellectual property protection and unauthorized disclosure</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h3>4.3 Current Risk Assessment</h3>
        <div class="fill-in">
            <p>The most recent comprehensive supply chain risk assessment was conducted on <em>Date to be populated</em> and evaluated <em>Number to be populated</em> suppliers across <em>Number to be populated</em> risk categories. Key findings include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>High-Risk Suppliers:</strong> <em>Number to be populated</em> suppliers identified with high-risk ratings requiring immediate attention</li>
                <li><strong>Critical Vulnerabilities:</strong> <em>Number to be populated</em> critical vulnerabilities identified in supplier products or services</li>

                <li><strong>Risk Transfer:</strong> Transferring risk through insurance, contractual indemnification, or service level agreements with suppliers</li>
                <li><strong>Risk Acceptance:</strong> Formally accepting residual risk when mitigation costs exceed potential impact, or when risk is within organizational tolerance levels</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Risk treatment decisions are documented and approved by the CISO or designated risk authority. All accepted risks are reviewed annually or when significant changes occur in the threat landscape or organizational risk tolerance.</p>
