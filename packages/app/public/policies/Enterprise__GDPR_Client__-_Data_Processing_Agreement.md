or identifiable natural person that is Processed by ERMITS in connection
with providing the Services.\

means of Processing Personal Data (Customer).\
\

vulnerability findings, or compliance documentation\

account information)\

encrypted cloud-stored data\
\
This DPA covers only Personal Data that ERMITS actually Processes, which
is minimal by design.\
