\
\## INTRODUCTION\
\
These Standard Contractual Clauses ("SCCs") are issued pursuant to
European Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2021/914 of 4 June 2021
on standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to
third countries.\
\
\*\*Purpose:\*\* These SCCs govern transfers of personal data from the
European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom, or Switzerland to ERMITS
LLC in the United States, ensuring adequate safeguards under GDPR
Article 46.\
\
\*\*Parties:\*\*\
\
- \*\*Data Exporter:\*\* The Customer (located in EEA/UK/Switzerland)\
- \*\*Data Importer:\*\* ERMITS LLC (United States)\
\
\*\*Applicable Modules:\*\*\
\
- Module One: Controller to Controller (where applicable)\
- Module Two: Controller to Processor (primary module)\
\
\-\-\-\--\
\
\## SECTION I -- PURPOSE AND SCOPE\
\
\*\*Clause 1: Purpose\*\*\
\
The purpose of these standard contractual clauses is to ensure
compliance with the requirements of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR) for
the transfer of personal data to a third country (United States).\
\
\*\*Clause 2: Invariability of the Clauses\*\*\
\
(a) The Parties undertake not to modify the Clauses. This does not
preclude the Parties from adding clauses on business related issues
where required as long as they do not contradict the Clauses.\
\
(b) The Clauses are without prejudice to obligations to which the data
exporter is subject by virtue of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.\
\
\*\*Clause 3: Interpretation\*\*\
\
(a) Where these Clauses use terms that are defined in Regulation (EU)
2016/679, those terms shall have the same meaning as in that
Regulation.\
\
(b) These Clauses shall be read and interpreted in the light of the
provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.\
\
(c) These Clauses shall not be interpreted in a way that conflicts with
rights and obligations provided for in Regulation (EU) 2016/679.\
\
\*\*Clause 4: Hierarchy\*\*\
\
In the event of a contradiction between these Clauses and the provisions
of related agreements between the Parties, existing at the time these
Clauses are agreed or entered into thereafter, these Clauses shall
prevail.\
\
\-\-\-\--\
\
\## SECTION II -- OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES\
\
\*\*Clause 5: Data subject rights\*\*\
\
(a) ERMITS LLC (data importer) shall promptly inform the data exporter
of any request it has received from a data subject. It shall not respond
to that request itself unless it has been authorised to do so by the
data exporter.\
\
(b) ERMITS LLC shall assist the data exporter in fulfilling its
obligations to respond to data subjects' requests for the exercise of
their rights under Regulation (EU) 2016/679. In this regard, the Parties
shall set out in Annex II the appropriate technical and organisational
measures, taking into account the nature of the processing, by which the
assistance shall be provided, as well as the scope and the extent of the
assistance required.\
\
(c) In fulfilling its obligations under paragraphs (a) and (b), ERMITS
LLC shall comply with the instructions from the data exporter.\
\
\*\*ERMITS-Specific Implementation:\*\*\
\
Due to ERMITS' Privacy-First Architecture with zero-knowledge
encryption:\
\
- ERMITS cannot access encrypted data and therefore cannot directly
respond to data subject requests regarding encrypted content\
- Data exporters maintain direct control over data subject rights
through client-side data management\
- ERMITS provides tools for data export, deletion, and access within the
Services\
- Data exporters are responsible for responding to data subject requests
regarding encrypted data they control\
\
\*\*Clause 6: Description of the transfer(s)\*\*\
\
The details of the transfer(s), and in particular the categories of
personal data that are transferred and the purpose(s) for which they are
transferred, are specified in Annex I.B.\
\
\*\*Clause 7: Docking clause\*\*\
\
(a) An entity that is not a Party to these Clauses may, with the
agreement of the Parties, accede to these Clauses at any time, either as
a data exporter or as a data importer, by completing the Appendix and
signing Annex I.A.\
\
(b) Once it has completed the Appendix and signed Annex I.A, the
acceding entity shall become a Party to these Clauses and have the
rights and obligations of a data exporter or data importer in accordance
with its designation in Annex I.A.\
\
(c) The acceding entity shall have no rights or obligations arising
under these Clauses from the period prior to becoming a Party.\
\
\-\-\-\--\
\
\## SECTION II -- MODULE TWO: Controller to Processor\
\
\*\*Clause 8: Data protection safeguards\*\*\
\
The data exporter warrants that it has used reasonable efforts to
determine that the data importer (ERMITS LLC) is able, through the
implementation of appropriate technical and organisational measures, to
satisfy its obligations under these Clauses.\
\
\*\*8.1 Instructions\*\*\
\
(a) ERMITS LLC shall process the personal data only on documented
instructions from the data exporter. The data exporter may give such
instructions throughout the duration of the contract.\
\
(b) ERMITS LLC shall immediately inform the data exporter if it is
unable to follow those instructions.\
\
\*\*ERMITS-Specific Processing:\*\*\
\
ERMITS processes personal data according to the following instructions:\
\
- Provide the Services as described in the Master Terms of Service\
- Process authentication and account management data\
- Store encrypted user data (where cloud sync is enabled) without
ability to decrypt\
- Process pseudonymized telemetry data (if opted in by data exporter)\
- Respond to data subject requests as directed by data exporter\
- Delete data upon termination as specified in data retention policies\
\
\*\*8.2 Purpose limitation\*\*\
\
ERMITS LLC shall process the personal data only for the specific
purpose(s) of the transfer, as set out in Annex I.B, unless on further
instructions from the data exporter.\
\
\*\*8.3 Transparency\*\*\
\
On request, the data exporter shall make a copy of these Clauses,
including the Appendix as completed by the Parties, available to the
data subject free of charge. To the extent necessary to protect business
secrets or other confidential information, including personal data, the
data exporter may redact part of the text of the Appendix prior to
sharing a copy, but shall provide a meaningful summary where the data
subject would otherwise not be able to understand its content or
exercise his/her rights.\
\
\*\*8.4 Accuracy\*\*\
\
If ERMITS LLC becomes aware that the personal data it has received is
inaccurate, or has become outdated, it shall inform the data exporter
without undue delay. In this case, ERMITS LLC shall cooperate with the
data exporter to erase or rectify the data.\
\
\*\*ERMITS Note:\*\* Due to zero-knowledge encryption, ERMITS cannot
determine accuracy of encrypted data. Data exporter maintains
responsibility for data accuracy.\
\
\*\*8.5 Duration of processing and erasure or return of data\*\*\
\
Processing by ERMITS LLC shall only take place for the duration
specified in Annex I.B. After the end of the provision of the processing
services, ERMITS LLC shall, at the choice of the data exporter, delete
all personal data processed on behalf of the data exporter and certify
to the data exporter that it has done so, or return to the data exporter
all personal data processed on its behalf and delete existing copies.
Until the data is deleted or returned, ERMITS LLC shall continue to
ensure compliance with these Clauses.\
\
\*\*ERMITS Implementation:\*\*\
\
- Data retention periods specified in Annex I.B and Privacy Policy\
- Upon termination: 30-day grace period for data export (paid accounts)\
- Permanent deletion within 90 days of termination\
- Deletion certification available upon request\
- Pseudonymized analytics retained (cannot identify individuals)\
\
\*\*8.6 Security of processing\*\*\
\
(a) ERMITS LLC and the data exporter shall implement appropriate
technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of the
data, including during transmission, and protection against a breach of
security leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss,
alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access to that data (personal
data breach).\
\
(b) ERMITS LLC shall grant access to the personal data to members of its
personnel only to the extent strictly necessary for the implementation,
management and monitoring of the contract. It shall ensure that persons
authorised to process the personal data have committed themselves to
confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of
confidentiality.\
\
(c) In the event of a personal data breach concerning personal data
processed by ERMITS LLC under these Clauses, ERMITS LLC shall take
appropriate measures to address the breach, including measures to
mitigate its adverse effects. ERMITS LLC shall also notify the data
exporter without undue delay after having become aware of the breach.\
\
\*\*ERMITS Security Measures:\*\* (Detailed in Annex II)\
\
- TLS 1.3 encryption for data in transit\
- AES-256-GCM client-side encryption for data at rest (zero-knowledge)\

\
\*\*MODULE TWO - Controller to Processor:\*\*\
\
(a) GENERAL WRITTEN AUTHORISATION: ERMITS LLC has the data exporter's
general authorisation for the engagement of sub-processor(s) from an
agreed list. ERMITS LLC shall specifically inform the data exporter in
writing of any intended changes to that list through the addition or
replacement of sub-processors at least 30 days in advance, thereby
giving the data exporter sufficient time to be able to object to such
changes prior to the engagement of the sub-processor(s).\
\
(b) Where ERMITS LLC engages a sub-processor to carry out specific
processing activities (on behalf of the data exporter), it shall do so
by way of a written contract that provides for, in substance, the same
data protection obligations as bind ERMITS LLC under these Clauses.
ERMITS LLC shall ensure that the sub-processor complies with the
obligations to which ERMITS LLC is subject pursuant to these Clauses.\
\
(c) ERMITS LLC shall provide, at the data exporter's request, a copy of
such a sub-processor agreement and any subsequent amendments to the data
exporter. To the extent necessary to protect business secrets or other
confidential information, ERMITS LLC may redact the text of the
agreement prior to sharing a copy.\
\
(d) ERMITS LLC shall remain fully responsible to the data exporter for
the performance of the sub-processor's obligations under its contract
with ERMITS LLC. ERMITS LLC shall notify the data exporter of any
failure by the sub-processor to fulfil its obligations under that
contract.\
\
(e) ERMITS LLC shall agree a third-party beneficiary clause with the
sub-processor whereby -- in the event ERMITS LLC has factually
disappeared, ceased to exist in law or has become insolvent -- the data
exporter shall have the right to terminate the sub-processor contract
and to instruct the sub-processor to erase or return the personal data.\

supervisory authority with responsibility for ensuring compliance by the
data exporter with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 as regards the data
transfer, as indicated in Annex I.C, shall act as competent supervisory
authority.\
\
Where the data exporter is not established in an EU Member State, but

\
\-\-\-\--\
\
\## SECTION III -- LOCAL LAWS AND OBLIGATIONS IN CASE OF ACCESS BY
PUBLIC AUTHORITIES\
\
\*\*Clause 14: Local laws and practices affecting compliance with the
Clauses\*\*\
\
\*\*MODULE TWO -- Transfer controller to processor\*\*\
\
(a) The Parties warrant that they have no reason to believe that the
laws and practices in the third country of destination applicable to the
processing of the personal data by ERMITS LLC, including any
requirements to disclose personal data or measures authorising access by
public authorities, prevent ERMITS LLC from fulfilling its obligations
under these Clauses. This is based on the understanding that laws and
practices that respect the essence of the fundamental rights and
freedoms and do not exceed what is necessary and proportionate in a
democratic society to safeguard one of the objectives listed in Article
23(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, are not in contradiction with these
Clauses.\
\
(b) The Parties declare that in providing the warranty in paragraph (a),
they have taken due account in particular of the following elements:\
(i) the specific circumstances of the transfer, including the length of
the processing chain, the number of actors involved and the transmission
channels used; intended onward transfers; the type of recipient; the
purpose of processing; the categories and format of the transferred
personal data; the economic sector in which the transfer occurs; the
storage location of the data transferred;\
\
(ii) the laws and practices of the third country of destination--
including those requiring the disclosure of data to public authorities
or authorising access by such authorities -- relevant in light of the
specific circumstances of the transfer, and the applicable limitations
and safeguards;\
\
(iii) any relevant contractual, technical or organisational safeguards
put in place to supplement the safeguards under these Clauses, including
measures applied during transmission and to the processing of the
personal data in the country of destination.\
\
\*\*ERMITS-Specific Analysis:\*\*\
\
\*\*United States Legal Framework:\*\*\
\
ERMITS LLC is subject to United States law, including:\
\
- \*\*FISA Section 702:\*\* Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act
provisions that may permit U.S. intelligence agencies to access certain
data\
- \*\*Executive Order 12333:\*\* Authorizes intelligence collection
activities\
- \*\*National Security Letters (NSLs):\*\* FBI may issue NSLs for
certain subscriber information\
- \*\*CLOUD Act:\*\* Permits U.S. law enforcement access to data
controlled by U.S. companies\
\
\*\*Mitigating Factors:\*\*\
\
1. \*\*Privacy-First Architecture with Zero-Knowledge Encryption:\*\*\
\
- Customer data encrypted client-side with AES-256-GCM\
- ERMITS cannot decrypt customer data (zero-knowledge)\
- Encryption keys derived from customer credentials, never transmitted
to ERMITS\
- Even under lawful government request, ERMITS cannot provide decrypted
data\
\
1. \*\*Minimal Data Collection:\*\*\
\
- ERMITS does not collect or store sensitive assessment data, SBOM
contents, CUI, FCI, or proprietary business information\
- Only account metadata collected (name, email, company)\
- Pseudonymized telemetry cannot identify individuals\
\
1. \*\*Transparency and Legal Challenge:\*\*\
\
- ERMITS challenges overly broad or improper government requests\
- Notifies affected customers when legally permitted\
- Publishes transparency reports (when volume justifies)\
\
1. \*\*Technical Impossibility:\*\*\
\
- Due to zero-knowledge architecture, ERMITS technically cannot comply
with requests for encrypted data content\
- Government access limited to unencrypted metadata only\
\
1. \*\*No Government Access Without Legal Process:\*\*\
\
- ERMITS does not provide voluntary or warrantless access\
- Requires valid legal process (subpoena, court order, warrant)\
- Reviews requests for legal sufficiency\
\
(c) ERMITS LLC warrants that, in carrying out the assessment under
paragraph (b), it has made its best efforts to provide the data exporter
with relevant information and agrees that it will continue to cooperate
with the data exporter in ensuring compliance with these Clauses.\
\
(d) The Parties agree to document the assessment under paragraph (b) and
make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.\
\
(e) ERMITS LLC agrees to notify the data exporter promptly if, after
having agreed to these Clauses and for the duration of the contract, it
has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws or
practices not in line with the requirements under paragraph (a),
including following a change in the laws of the third country or a
measure (such as a disclosure request) indicating an application of such
laws in practice that is not in line with the requirements in paragraph
(a).\
\
(f) Following a notification pursuant to paragraph (e), or if the data
exporter otherwise has reason to believe that ERMITS LLC can no longer
fulfil its obligations under these Clauses, the data exporter shall
promptly identify appropriate measures (e.g. technical or organisational
measures to ensure security and confidentiality) to be adopted by the
data exporter and/or ERMITS LLC to address the situation. The data
exporter shall suspend the data transfer if it considers that no
appropriate safeguards for such transfer can be ensured, or if
instructed by the competent supervisory authority to do so. In this
case, the data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract,
insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under these
Clauses. If the contract involves more than two Parties, the data
exporter may exercise this right to termination only with respect to the
relevant Party, unless the Parties have agreed otherwise. Where the
contract is terminated pursuant to this Clause, Clause 16(d) and (e)
shall apply.\
\
\*\*Clause 15: Obligations of the data importer in case of access by
public authorities\*\*\
\
\*\*MODULE TWO -- Transfer controller to processor\*\*\
\
\*\*15.1 Notification\*\*\
\
(a) ERMITS LLC agrees to notify the data exporter and, where possible,
the data subject promptly (if necessary with the help of the data
exporter) if it:\
(i) receives a legally binding request from a public authority,
including judicial authorities, under the laws of the country of
destination for the disclosure of personal data transferred pursuant to
these Clauses; such notification shall include information about the
personal data requested, the requesting authority, the legal basis for
the request and the response provided; or\
\
(ii) becomes aware of any direct access by public authorities to
personal data transferred pursuant to these Clauses in accordance with
the laws of the country of destination; such notification shall include
all information available to the importer.\
\
(b) If ERMITS LLC is prohibited from notifying the data exporter and/or
the data subject under the laws of the country of destination, ERMITS
LLC agrees to use its best efforts to obtain a waiver of the
prohibition, with a view to communicating as much information as
possible, as soon as possible. ERMITS LLC agrees to document its best
efforts in order to be able to demonstrate them on request of the data
exporter.\
\
(c) Where permissible under the laws of the country of destination,
ERMITS LLC agrees to provide the data exporter, at regular intervals for
the duration of the contract, with as much relevant information as
possible on the requests received (in particular, number of requests,
type of data requested, requesting authority/ies, whether requests have
been challenged and the outcome of such challenges, etc.).\
\
(d) ERMITS LLC agrees to preserve the information pursuant to paragraphs
(a) to (c) for the duration of the contract and make it available to the
competent supervisory authority on request.\
\
(e) Paragraphs (a) to (c) are without prejudice to the obligation of
ERMITS LLC pursuant to Clause 14(e) and Clause 16 to inform the data
exporter promptly where it is unable to comply with these Clauses.\
\
\*\*ERMITS Implementation:\*\*\
\
- \*\*Prompt Notification:\*\* ERMITS will notify data exporter within
48 hours of receiving a government data request (unless legally
prohibited)\
- \*\*Notification Contents:\*\* Nature of request, data sought, legal
authority, ERMITS' response\
- \*\*Challenge Process:\*\* ERMITS reviews all requests for legal
sufficiency and challenges improper requests\
- \*\*Transparency Report:\*\* Annual transparency report published (if
request volume warrants)\
- \*\*Zero-Knowledge Limitation:\*\* ERMITS will inform requesting
authority of technical inability to decrypt zero-knowledge encrypted
data\
\
\*\*15.2 Review of legality and data minimisation\*\*\
\
(a) ERMITS LLC agrees to review the legality of the request for
disclosure, in particular whether it remains within the powers granted
to the requesting public authority, and to challenge the request if,
after careful assessment, it concludes that there are reasonable grounds
to consider that the request is unlawful under the laws of the country
of destination, applicable obligations under international law and
principles of international comity. ERMITS LLC shall, under the same
conditions, pursue possibilities of appeal. When challenging a request,
ERMITS LLC shall seek interim measures with a view to suspending the
effects of the request until the competent judicial authority has
decided on its merits. It shall not disclose the personal data requested
until required to do so under the applicable procedural rules. These
requirements are without prejudice to the obligations of ERMITS LLC
under Clause 14(e).\
\
(b) ERMITS LLC agrees to document its legal assessment and any challenge
to the request for disclosure and, to the extent permissible under the
laws of the country of destination, make the documentation available to
the data exporter. It shall also make it available to the competent
supervisory authority on request.\
\

In these cases, it shall inform the competent supervisory authority of
such non-compliance. Where the contract involves more than two Parties,
the data exporter may exercise this right to termination only with
respect to the relevant Party, unless the Parties have agreed
otherwise.\
\
(d) Personal data that has been transferred prior to the termination of
the contract pursuant to paragraph (c) shall at the choice of the data
exporter immediately be returned to the data exporter or deleted in its
entirety. The same shall apply to any copies of the data. ERMITS LLC
shall certify the deletion of the data to the data exporter. Until the
data is deleted or returned, ERMITS LLC shall continue to ensure
compliance with these Clauses. In case of local laws applicable to
ERMITS LLC that prohibit the return or deletion of the transferred
personal data, ERMITS LLC warrants that it will continue to ensure
compliance with these Clauses and will only process the data to the
extent and for as long as required under that local law.\
\
(e) Either Party may revoke its agreement to be bound by these Clauses
where (i) the European Commission adopts a decision pursuant to Article
45(3) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the transfer of personal
data to which these Clauses apply; or (ii) Regulation (EU) 2016/679
becomes part of the legal framework of the country to which the personal
data is transferred. This is without prejudice to other obligations
applying to the processing in question under Regulation (EU) 2016/679.\
\
\*\*Clause 17: Governing law\*\*\
\
\*\*MODULE TWO -- Transfer controller to processor\*\*\
\
These Clauses shall be governed by the law of one of the EU Member
States, provided such law allows for third-party beneficiary rights. The
Parties agree that this shall be the law of the Member State in which
the data exporter is established. Where the data exporter is not
established in an EU Member State, the Parties agree that these Clauses
shall be governed by the law of Ireland.\

\## SWISS DATA PROTECTION ACT PROVISIONS\
\
\*\*Addendum for Transfers Subject to Swiss Federal Data Protection Act
(FADP)\*\*\
\
Where the data exporter is subject to the Swiss Federal Data Protection
Act (FADP), the following provisions apply in addition to the EU
Standard Contractual Clauses:\
\
\*\*1. Swiss Supervisory Authority\*\*\
\
The competent supervisory authority for Swiss data transfers is the
Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC):\
\
- Address: Feldeggweg 1, 3003 Berne, Switzerland\
- Website: \<<https://www.edoeb.admin.ch>\>\
- The FDPIC has investigation and enforcement powers equivalent to EU
supervisory authorities\
\
\*\*2. Swiss Data Subject Rights\*\*\
\
Data subjects in Switzerland have the same rights as under GDPR,
including:\
\
- Right of access\
- Right to rectification\
- Right to erasure\
- Right to data portability\
- Right to object\
- Right to lodge complaint with FDPIC\
\
\*\*3. References to GDPR\*\*\
\
For Swiss transfers:\
\
- References to "Regulation (EU) 2016/679" are replaced with "Swiss
Federal Data Protection Act"\
- References to "EU Member State" are replaced with "Switzerland"\
- References to GDPR Articles are interpreted as corresponding FADP
provisions\
\
\*\*4. Governing Law and Jurisdiction\*\*\
\
For disputes involving Swiss data exporters:\
\
- Governing law: Swiss law (where Swiss law is more protective)\
- Jurisdiction: Swiss courts have jurisdiction\
- Data subjects may also bring claims in the courts of their habitual

- Social security measures\
- Administrative/criminal proceedings\
\
Additional safeguards required for such data under Swiss law.\
\

\
Data breaches must be reported to FDPIC where there is a high risk to
data subjects' personality or fundamental rights, without undue delay.\
\
\*\*8. Data Protection Impact Assessment\*\*\
