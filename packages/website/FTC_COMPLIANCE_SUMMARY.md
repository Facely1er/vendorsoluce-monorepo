# FTC Compliance Summary - Quick Reference

## ⚠️ Critical Issues Found

The original content contained several ROI metrics that may violate FTC advertising guidelines:

1. **"$180K Annual Savings"** - Specific dollar amount without substantiation
2. **"$10-44M Risk Eliminated"** - Vague and potentially misleading
3. **"95% Time Savings"** - Specific percentage without qualification
4. **"12 hours vs 240+ hours"** - Comparison without context
5. **"95% completion rate"** - Specific percentage without qualification
6. **"6 weeks vs 6 months"** - Comparison without substantiation

## 🎯 Recommended Approach

### Option 1: Qualitative Benefits (Safest - Recommended)
Use descriptive language instead of specific metrics:

```html
✅ "Faster time to insights"
✅ "Improved vendor engagement"  
✅ "Better risk visibility"
✅ "Enhanced process efficiency"
```

**Avoid:**
```html
❌ "$180K Annual Savings"
❌ "95% Time Savings"
❌ "12 hours vs 240+ hours"
```

### Option 2: Qualified Metrics (If You Have Data)
If you have substantiation, use qualified language:

```html
✅ "Up to 95%* potential time savings"
✅ "Significant* cost reduction potential"
✅ "*Results vary by organization"
```

**Must Include:**
- "Up to" or "potential" qualifiers
- Prominent disclaimers
- Methodology disclosure
- Typical vs. exceptional distinction
