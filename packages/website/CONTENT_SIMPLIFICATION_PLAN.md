# VendorSoluce Homepage - Content Simplification Plan

## Issues Identified

### 1. Repetitive Headings
- **"Value delivered"**: Appears 3 times in outcomes section
- **"What changes"**: Appears 3 times in outcomes section
- **"Evidence Vault"**: Appears 2 times (hero + features)

### 2. Verbose Sections
- **Outcomes section**: 1,810 characters (~202 words) - TOO LONG
- **Benefits section**: 1,622 characters (~188 words) - TOO LONG
- **Three Processes section**: 664 characters with repetitive structure

### 3. Excessive Total Content
- Current: ~1,728 words total
- Target: ~1,000-1,200 words (30% reduction)

---

## Simplification Strategy

### Phase 1: Consolidate "Outcomes" Section
**BEFORE:** 3 separate cards, each with:
- Heading
- Description
- "Value delivered" subheading + 4 bullets
- "What changes" subheading + description

**AFTER:** Single streamlined table or compact grid:
```
Stage → Outcome → Key Change
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Radar → Risk clarity + continuous monitoring → Focused attention, not equal treatment
Assessment → Confident requirements + gaps → Explicit controls, not generic checklists  
Due Diligence → Defensible decisions + proof → Audit-ready trail, not compliance theater
```

**Savings:** ~1,200 characters

---

### Phase 2: Merge "Three Processes" into "Solution"
**BEFORE:** Two separate sections describing the same 3 stages

**AFTER:** Single section with:
- Brief description of each stage
- Remove duplicate explanations
- Keep radar monitoring emphasis once (not 3x)

**Savings:** ~400 characters

---

### Phase 3: Simplify "Benefits" Section
**BEFORE:** Long table with 6 rows comparing traditional vs. VendorSoluce

**AFTER:** Compact bullet points:
- 3-4 key improvements only
- Remove verbose table structure
- Focus on outcomes, not process details

**Savings:** ~600 characters

---

### Phase 4: Consolidate "Evidence Vault"
**BEFORE:** Mentioned in hero card AND features section

**AFTER:** Keep in features section only
- Remove from hero card (redundant)
- Hero card should focus on high-level outcomes

**Savings:** ~80 characters

---

### Phase 5: Reduce "What you can now prove" Duplication
**BEFORE:** Separate section + similar content in packages

**AFTER:** Merge key points into packages section
- Remove standalone section
- Integrate proof points into relevant packages

**Savings:** ~300 characters

---

## Proposed New Structure

### Hero Section
✅ Keep as is (concise, clear value prop)

### Metrics Section  
✅ Keep as is (visual, not text-heavy)

### Problem Section
✅ Keep as is (establishes need well)

### Outcomes Section → **SIMPLIFIED "Value Journey"**
```
Single compact grid showing:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Stage       | Outcome              | Change
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Radar       | Know where risk is   | Focused → not equal
Assessment  | Know what's required | Explicit → not generic
Due Diligence| Prove decisions     | Audit-ready → not theater
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
+ Continuous monitoring throughout (stated once)
```

### Solution Section (merged with three-processes)
```
**The 3-Stage Lifecycle**
1. Radar: Find exposure + monitor changes
2. Assessment: Define requirements + identify gaps
3. Due Diligence: Link evidence + enable defense
```

### Features Section
✅ Keep as is (clear capabilities list)

### Packages Section
✅ Keep as is (clear pricing tiers)

### Benefits Section → **REMOVED or DRASTICALLY REDUCED**
- Most content redundant with outcomes
- If kept: 3-4 bullet points max

### "What you can now prove" → **MERGED into Packages**

---

## Expected Results

### Content Reduction
- From: ~8,058 characters
- To: ~5,500 characters  
- **Savings: ~2,500 characters (31% reduction)**

### Word Count Reduction
- From: ~1,728 words
- To: ~1,150 words
- **Savings: ~578 words (33% reduction)**

### Readability Improvements
✅ Eliminate repetition (3x "Value delivered", 3x "What changes")
✅ Reduce cognitive load (less to read, same information)
✅ Faster page scan (clear hierarchy)
✅ Better mobile experience (less scrolling)

---

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Do First)
1. ✅ Consolidate Outcomes section (biggest win)
2. ✅ Merge three-processes into solution
3. ✅ Simplify benefits section

### Medium Priority
4. Remove "Evidence Vault" from hero
5. Consolidate "What you can now prove"

### Low Priority  
6. Minor text trimming in other sections

---

## Key Principle

**Show, don't repeat.**

Instead of saying the same thing 3 different ways:
- Say it once, clearly
- Use visual hierarchy (tables, grids)
- Let the user absorb and move on

The goal is **decision-ready clarity**, not **exhaustive repetition**.
