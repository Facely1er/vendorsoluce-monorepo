# STEEL™ Core Engine

STEEL (Strategic Threat & Enterprise Evaluation Layer) is a decision-grade
governance layer. It does NOT assess controls, tools, or policies.

Rules:
- Inputs come from ERMITS platforms or executive responses
- Outputs are fixed, board-consumable, and non-negotiable
- No framework mapping (ISO/NIST/CMMC) inside STEEL
- No control-level logic allowed

This folder defines the canonical STEEL data contract.
