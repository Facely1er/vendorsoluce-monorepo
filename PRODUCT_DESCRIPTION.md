## The Problem We Solve

Organizations today manage hundreds of vendor relationships, each representing potential security and compliance risks. Traditional vendor risk management is:

- **Time-consuming** - Manual assessments typically take 240+ hours over 12+ months
- **Incomplete** - Many organizations report that 50-70% of vendors lack current security assessments
- **Reactive** - Risk discovery often happens after incidents, not before
- **Fragmented** - Evidence scattered across emails, spreadsheets, and documents
- **Expensive** - Significant annual costs in manual vendor management

**The Result:** Organizations often operate with blind spots, potentially exposing themselves to significant risk while struggling to demonstrate compliance during audits.
